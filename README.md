# Fuzz-Quick-Start-Guide

## Setup Metamask

Fuzz Bets is a DAPP that runs on the Harmony One blockchain, to interact with any DAPP on this blockchain you must setup a metmask wallet. Luckily there is a very thorough guide to do exactly this from [Harmony One themselves](https://docs.harmony.one/home/general/wallets/browser-extensions-wallets/metamask-wallet). The ONE coin is what fuels all transactions on the Harmony blockchain, a very small amount is needed for every transaction to complete. Transaction fees can range from a few dollars on some networks to a few cents on others, luckily Harmony ONE is one of the fastest and cheapest network to transact on and most transaction fees are fractions of a penny.

## Acquire ONE

To acquire the ONE coin I would recommend using the [RAMP network](https://ramp.network). RAMP accepts credit card payments with very low fees and deposit your purchased crypto asset directly into your personal wallet, this is the easiest way I have experience purchasing ONE. Other methods of purchasing ONE would involve using a centralized exchange like Binance, however the problem with centralized echanges is withdrawing the asset from the exchange to your persoanl wallet. Far too often centralized exchanges restrict withdrawls for one reason or another and can trap your fund on their platform.\
\
The amount of money you wish to put towards using Fuzz (or any other DAPP on Harmony) should first be placed into ONE. You can use decentralized echanges on Harmony to swap ONE for the tokens you may need, in this case, FUZZ.

## Acquire FUZZ

To participate in Fuzz Bets you must have some FUZZ tokens to author your own events or to place bets. The way to acquire FUZZ is by visiting the decentralized exchange on [fuzz swap](https://swap.fuzz.fi/swap), then swap some of your ONE for FUZZ. You must be careful and always reserves some ONE to pay for the transactions. If you are betting I would recommend keeping at least 5 ONE for these transactions, and if you're authoring I would recommend keeping at least 10 ONE on the side.

## Placing Bets

To participate in an event go to the fuzz bets [dashboard](https://fuzz.fi/FuzzBet) and browse for events you're interested in entering. You will need to complete two transactions for every event you enter, one to approve the event contract to access some of your FUZZ, and the other to submit the amount of FUZZ you want to place on the event. The payout of events on fuzz is a function of your % share of the winning side's pool of fuzz less the 10% commission givent to the author and burning mechanics.\
\
Example and event has Side A with 20000 FUZZ bet on it, and Side B with 30000 FUZZ bet on it.\
Side A wins and your bet was 2000 FUZZ.\
\
Your payout is caluclated as follows\
\
Your share of winning pool = 2000/20000 = 0.1 or 10%\
The effective pot for the winners = 30000\*0.9 = 27000\
Your winnings = 0.1\*27000 = 2700 FUZZ\
\
Amount returned = original bet + winnings = 4700 FUZZ
