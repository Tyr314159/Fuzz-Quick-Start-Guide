# Fuzz-Quick-Start-Guide

## Setup Metamask

Fuzz Bets is a DAPP that runs on the Harmony One blockchain, to interact with any DAPP on this blockchain you must setup a metmask wallet. Luckily there is a very thorough guide to do exactly this from [Harmony One themselves](https://docs.harmony.one/home/general/wallets/browser-extensions-wallets/metamask-wallet). The ONE coin is what fuels all transactions on the Harmony blockchain, a very small amount is needed for every transaction to complete. Transaction fees can range from a few dollars on some networks to a few cents on others, luckily Harmony ONE is one of the fastest and cheapest network to transact on and most transaction fees are fractions of a penny.

## Acquire ONE

To acquire the ONE coin I would recommend using the [RAMP network](https://ramp.network). RAMP accepts credit card payments with very low fees and deposit your purchased crypto asset directly into your personal wallet, this is the easiest way I have experience purchasing ONE. Other methods of purchasing ONE would involve using a centralized exchange like Binance, however the problem with centralized echanges is withdrawing the asset from the exchange to your persoanl wallet. Far too often centralized exchanges restrict withdrawls for one reason or another and can trap your fund on their platform.\

The amount of money you wish to put towards using Fuzz (or any other DAPP on Harmony) should first be placed into ONE. You can use decentralized echanges on Harmony to swap ONE for the tokens you may need, in this case, FUZZ.

## Acquire FUZZ

To participate in Fuzz Bets you must have some FUZZ tokens to author your own events or to place bets.
